# PersonalJournalApp
This is a Personal Journal application where users can keep track of their daily life.

### Check-in 1 Notes
- I have created the class library for my Model classes.
- I have created a MVC project for the Web App.
- I have created a Web API project.
- I have scaffolded all the controllers for both the Web App and API.
- I have modified the defaulted scaffolded pages and refined the UI.
- **As part of my ancillary goals, I used Azure to host my website, database and web API**.
- I have created a MS-Test project for my initial integration testing

### Check-in 2 Notes
- **As part of my ancillary goals, I have added a location field with auto-complete functionality which will access the Google Places API using an API Key.**

- **As part of my ancillary goals, I modifed the index page to add extra functionality aside from the default ones.**
  - I added a search functionality for the journal entries where users can search a specific entry using the title
  - I added a sort functionality to sort the journal entry dates by either ascending or descending order.
  
- **As part of my ancillary goals, I have started adding the speech-to-text functionality to populate subsection texts.**
  - I am still finalizing the speech to text part, I am thinking to have a single microphone button for all the text fields to simplify the logic instead of having to switch the mic on and off for different subsection texts.   

- I have added few integration tests for the CRUD operations. The test for the Create Journal Entry scenario is still pending.
- I have fixed some issues with the app

### Check-in 3 Notes

Planned Activities for Check-in 3:
- Finalize the integration tests
- Add more custom CSS to change the look and feel of the website

- Finalize the speech-to-text functionality for the Create/Edit Journal Entries
